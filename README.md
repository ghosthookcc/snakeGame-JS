# snakeGame-JS
My first game, made with vanilla JS, not well optimized but a first project nonetheless...

TODO:

      -- add new piece of snake to back not front (can not eat apples next to wall on x-axis)

PATCH v1:

      -- added colider to snake

      -- fixed apple eating

      -- fixed wall colider
