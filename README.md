# snakeGame-JS
My first game, made with vanilla JS, not well optimized but a first project nonetheless...

TODO:

      -- remove vertical movement

      -- add colider to snake, lose con

      -- quick movement makes snake not apple some times (can be realted to vertical movement)

      -- doesen't directly die when hitting wall (can be realted to vertical movement)

      -- quick movement makes snake not eat apple some times (related to timing of methods)
